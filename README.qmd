## Introduction

This is the research repo for implementing an options pricing engine in the Julia programming language.

## Project Status

Prezo.jl currently implements:
- European and American vanilla options (calls and puts)
- Multiple pricing engines: Black-Scholes, Binomial trees, Monte Carlo, Longstaff-Schwartz LSM
- Multiple basis functions for LSM regression (Laguerre, Chebyshev, Power, Hermite)
- Comprehensive documentation with Documenter.jl
- BlueStyle-compliant codebase

## TODO: Next Steps

### High Priority

- [ ] **Formal Test Suite** (`test/runtests.jl`)
  - Unit tests for all pricing engines
  - Convergence tests (binomial vs analytical as steps → ∞)
  - Regression tests to prevent breaking changes
  - Property-based testing for option pricing bounds
  - Test against known benchmark values

- [ ] **Greeks Calculation**
  - Analytical Greeks for Black-Scholes (delta, gamma, theta, vega, rho)
  - Numerical Greeks via finite differences for other engines
  - Greeks for American options via LSM
  - Aggregate portfolio Greeks

- [ ] **Implied Volatility Solver**
  - Newton-Raphson method using vega
  - Bisection fallback for robustness
  - Vectorized IV calculation for option chains
  - Volatility surface construction

### Medium Priority

- [ ] **Performance Optimization**
  - Benchmark suite comparing all engines
  - Profile and optimize hot paths in LSM algorithm
  - Investigate @turbo from LoopVectorization.jl
  - Parallel Monte Carlo with Threads.@threads
  - GPU acceleration investigation (CUDA.jl)

- [ ] **Early Exercise Boundary Analysis**
  - Compute and plot optimal exercise boundary for American options
  - Compare with theoretical results (e.g., American put approximations)
  - Sensitivity analysis of exercise boundary to parameters

- [ ] **Enhanced Dividend Handling**
  - Discrete dividend payments (ex-dividend dates and amounts)
  - Mixed continuous yield + discrete dividends
  - Dividend impact on American call early exercise

- [ ] **Continuous Integration**
  - GitHub Actions workflow for testing
  - Code coverage reporting (Codecov)
  - Documentation deployment automation
  - Compatibility testing across Julia versions

### Low Priority

- [ ] **Exotic Options**
  - Asian options (arithmetic and geometric averaging)
  - Barrier options (knock-in, knock-out)
  - Lookback options (fixed and floating strike)
  - Digital/binary options

- [ ] **Advanced Volatility Models**
  - Local volatility surface (Dupire model)
  - Stochastic volatility (Heston model)
  - SABR model for volatility smile

- [ ] **Market Data Integration**
  - Real-time option chain fetching
  - Historical data analysis
  - Volatility surface fitting from market data

- [ ] **Risk Management Tools**
  - VaR (Value at Risk) calculation
  - CVaR (Conditional VaR)
  - Portfolio-level stress testing
  - Scenario analysis framework

- [ ] **Extended Documentation**
  - Jupyter notebook tutorials
  - Comparison with QuantLib benchmarks
  - Financial mathematics background section
  - Performance comparison guide

### Research/Exploration
